# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Univariate Analysis

This project demonstrates **Univariate Data Analysis** using the famous **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle.

## 📌 What is Univariate Analysis?
Univariate analysis means analyzing **one variable at a time** to understand:
- Distribution
- Central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Spread (variance, standard deviation, IQR)
- Frequency counts (for categorical variables)
